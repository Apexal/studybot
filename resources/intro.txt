This Discord server is totally automated by me, a bot created by the **Founder Frank Matranga**.
This allows the server to be totally customized to Regis High School.
You have access to **private advisement text-channels** to replace the old-school annoying advisement email chain.
You also have access to **private course text-channels** for each of your main classes.
You can join user-made groups (or create your own) by typing `!groups`.
For example, interested in gaming with your schoolmates? Type `!join 'Gaming'` right now!
Or, want to create a group (and associated text-channel) for a club? Type `!creategroup "Name" "Description"`.
Want to focus on studying/working? Use `!study` to toggle distractions.
Use `!help` and `!help commandname` to see more options!

If you have any questions, direct message Frank (<@152621041976344577>).
